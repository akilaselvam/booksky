                    Our formula was simple: have more cash flowing in every month from our investments than was flowing out in living expenses. In 1994 we simply had $10,000 per month in cash flow coming in every month, primarily from our rental real estate investments, and $3,000 per month going out in living expenses. At that point, thanks to Rich Dad’s principles, we were financially free.It was at that point that we asked ourselves, “What is it we truly want to do with our lives?”  We believe that the purpose of a business is to solve problems. The problem we set out to solve was that there was little-to-no financial education being taught in the school system…worldwide. So we took on the task to provide real financial education to people all over the world. We wanted to keep it simple.
